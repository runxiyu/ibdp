# An Anthology by Langston Hughes

**Note:** I was unable to find a published work with this exact name.

## Copyright status
1. Poems published before 1 January 1929 are public domain in all relevant
   jurisdictions. These poems may therefore be included in this repository.
2. Pursuant to Article 23 of the Copyright Act of the People's Republic of
   China amended in 2020, all works of Langston Hughes are now in the public
   domain in the People's Republic of China, as he died more than 50 years ago.
   However, the United States and Canada have it set at 70 years. Therefore,
   you **cannot** include poems published on or after 1 January 1929 in this
   repository.
3. Notwithstanding item 2 of this list, poems published after 1 January 1929
   maybe included in this repository if it is accompanied by literary
   criticism. See
   [section 4 of the Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Poetry].
