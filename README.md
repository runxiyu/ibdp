## Copyright and licensing

Most of this repository is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 International,
but individual files may be licensed differently. Refer to the headers
of each file to determine their respective licenses.

A copy of CC BY-SA 4.0 International is located in the `LICENSE` file.

Contributors are required to
[sign off their commits](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff)
to indicate that they agree to the
[Developer's Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)
in the context of their commit.

Although the maintainer and contributors are located in the People's
Republic of China, the server hosting the canonical copy of this
repository is in Canada, and mirrors may exist on other hosts such as
SourceHut, Codeberg, and GitHub. Therefore, the conveniences provided in
P.R.C. copyright law section 24.6, if applicable at all, **cannot** be
used in this repository.

Please note that
[CC BY-SA is not compatible with CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-combine-material-under-different-creative-commons-licenses-in-my-work).
Therefore, please do **not** include work licensed under CC BY-NC-SA in
files that are otherwise licensed under CC BY-SA. Content under CC
BY-NC-SA must be in independent files and must not be combined with
other content; for example, do not use
`\includegraphics{CC-BY-NC-SA-licensed-file}` in a file that is supposed
to be licensed CC BY-SA.

Another repository called `ibdp_extras` with relatively questionable
copyright is also provided but has very limited access. Please contact
me in real life or at my [school
email](mailto:s22537@stu.ykpaoschool.cn) to request access.

This is not legal advice.

## Disclaimer

In no event unless required by applicable law will any copyright holder,
author, or any other party, be liable to you for damages, including
any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising
out of the use or inability to use this document (including but not
limited to loss of sanity or your knowledge being rendered inaccurate
or losses sustained by you or third parties), even if such holder,
author, or other party has been advised of the possibility of such
damages. If the disclaimer and limitation of liability hereby provided
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
waiver of all civil liability in connection with this document.
